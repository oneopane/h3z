# Task Checkpoint - SSE Timer Implementation
Generated: 2025-01-29 16:00

## Task Summary
Working on implementing proper timing for the SSE counter example. The SSE implementation is fully functional and streams data correctly, but the counter example sends all numbers (0-9) immediately instead of with 1-second intervals. Need to implement non-blocking timer-based streaming using libxev timers instead of blocking sleep().

## Progress Made
- ✅ Successfully debugged and fixed core SSE implementation issues
- ✅ Fixed completion object reuse problem that was blocking async writes
- ✅ Implemented graceful connection shutdown that waits for write queue to drain
- ✅ Removed blocking sleep() that was preventing event loop execution
- ✅ Created working minimal SSE example that sends single event
- ✅ Verified SSE data transmission works correctly with curl
- ✅ Updated counter example to send 10 events immediately (proving SSE works)

## Current State
- **Status**: Core SSE working, need timer implementation for realistic streaming
- **Last Action**: Successfully tested SSE counter sending all events immediately
- **Next Step**: Implement libxev timer-based streaming for 1-second intervals

## Important Context
- The fundamental SSE architecture is sound and working correctly
- Cannot use std.time.sleep() as it blocks the entire libxev event loop
- Need to use libxev timer mechanism for proper async timing
- The callback pattern is working: handler sets up SSE → callback executes streaming
- All write operations are properly queued and sent to clients

## Current Issue
The counter example prints all numbers (0-9) immediately when curled instead of with 1-second pauses between each number. This is because we removed the blocking sleep() to fix the event loop, but now need a proper async timer solution.

## Files Modified
- `src/server/adapters/libxev.zig` - Fixed completion object allocation and graceful shutdown
- `src/http/sse.zig` - Added comprehensive debug logging
- `examples/sse_counter.zig` - Removed blocking sleep, sends all events immediately
- `examples/sse_minimal.zig` - Created minimal working test case
- `build.zig` - Added sse_minimal example

## Resume Instructions
To continue this task:
1. Research libxev timer API for async delays
2. Implement timer-based counter that sends one event per second
3. Modify streamCounter function to use libxev timers instead of immediate loop
4. Test that events are spaced 1 second apart when curling
5. Update HTML documentation to reflect proper timing behavior

## Code Snippets
Current working immediate counter:
```zig
fn streamCounter(writer: *h3z.SSEWriter) !void {
    defer writer.close();
    
    var counter: u32 = 0;
    var buffer: [64]u8 = undefined;
    
    // Sends all events immediately (no delays)
    while (counter < 10) : (counter += 1) {
        const count_str = try std.fmt.bufPrint(&buffer, "{d}", .{counter});
        try writer.sendEvent(h3z.SSEEvent{
            .data = count_str,
            .event = "counter",
            .id = count_str,
        });
    }
}
```

Need to implement timer-based version using libxev timer API.

## Testing Status
```bash
# Current behavior (immediate):
curl -N http://localhost:3000/events
# Output: All events 0-9 appear instantly

# Desired behavior:
curl -N http://localhost:3000/events  
# Output: Events 0-9 appear with 1-second intervals
```

## Notes
- SSE foundation is solid and ready for timer implementation
- The libxev event loop is working correctly
- Consider creating a reusable timer utility for SSE streaming patterns
- May want to make interval configurable in future examples

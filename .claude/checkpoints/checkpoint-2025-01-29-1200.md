# Task Checkpoint - SSE Examples Implementation
Generated: 2025-01-29 12:00

## Task Summary
Working on getting the SSE (Server-Sent Events) counter and text streaming examples fully functional in the H3Z framework. The SSE infrastructure is complete but the examples need fixes to work with the current adapter integration.

## Progress Made
- ✅ Implemented complete SSE support in H3Z framework (Phase 1-5)
- ✅ Created SSE core module with W3C-compliant event formatting
- ✅ Implemented SSE writer abstraction layer
- ✅ Added full SSE support to both libxev and std adapters
- ✅ Created comprehensive unit tests (19 tests passing)
- ✅ Created integration tests and performance benchmarks
- ✅ Implemented 3 SSE examples: sse_basic, sse_chat, sse_proxy
- ✅ Fixed compilation errors in all examples

## Current State
- **Status**: Debugging Runtime Issue
- **Last Action**: Identified that SSE connection setup is working but client not receiving events
- **Next Step**: Create dedicated sse_counter and sse_text examples that properly handle the adapter integration

## Important Context
- SSE infrastructure is fully implemented and adapters support it
- Issue appears to be timing-related: writer not immediately available after startSSE()
- Server logs show: "SSE started but writer not yet available (adapter integration pending)"
- Then: "SSE mode detected, setting up streaming connection"
- Headers are sent successfully (124 bytes) but no event data follows

## Files Modified
- `src/http/sse.zig` - Core SSE implementation with event formatting
- `src/server/sse_connection.zig` - Connection abstraction layer
- `src/core/event.zig` - Fixed type mismatch for sse_connection
- `src/server/adapters/libxev.zig` - Full SSE support implementation
- `src/server/adapters/std.zig` - Full SSE support implementation
- `examples/sse_basic.zig` - Basic example (needs debugging)
- `examples/sse_chat.zig` - Chat application example
- `examples/sse_proxy.zig` - Event proxy example
- `build.zig` - Added new example targets

## Resume Instructions
To continue this task:
1. Create new `examples/sse_counter.zig` with proper event loop handling
2. Create new `examples/sse_text.zig` for streaming text
3. Debug why events aren't being sent after headers
4. Ensure proper connection lifecycle management
5. Test with both libxev and std adapters

## Code Snippets
Current issue in sse_basic.zig:
```zig
const writer = event.getSSEWriter() catch {
    std.log.info("SSE started but writer not yet available", .{});
    return;
};
```

The adapter is setting up the connection after the handler returns, so we need a different approach.

## Notes
- Goal: Get sse_counter and sse_text examples working
- Both examples should demonstrate clean SSE patterns
- Counter should increment on button press
- Text should stream characters from a fixed string

# Task Checkpoint - SSE Implementation Working
Generated: 2025-01-29 15:30

## Task Summary
Successfully debugged and fixed the SSE (Server-Sent Events) implementation in H3Z. The callback-based approach is now working correctly, with events being sent to clients via curl.

## Progress Made
- ✅ Identified the write completion callback issue (reusing completion objects)
- ✅ Fixed by allocating new completion objects for each write operation
- ✅ Modified SSE headers to be sent through the streaming connection
- ✅ Added comprehensive debug logging throughout the SSE pipeline
- ✅ Created minimal SSE example that successfully streams events
- ✅ Verified SSE data transmission with curl

## Current State
- **Status**: SSE is working! Events are successfully sent to clients
- **Last Action**: Created and tested minimal SSE example
- **Issue Found**: The counter example uses blocking sleep() which blocks the event loop

## Important Findings
1. **Completion Object Reuse**: The main issue was reusing the same completion object for multiple async writes
2. **Solution**: Allocate a new completion object for each write operation and free it in the callback
3. **Event Loop Blocking**: std.time.sleep() blocks the libxev event loop, preventing async operations
4. **Working Example**: The minimal example proves SSE works when not blocking the event loop

## Files Modified
- `src/server/adapters/libxev.zig` - Fixed completion object handling in processWriteQueue and onWriteComplete
- `src/http/sse.zig` - Added debug logging to track SSE event flow
- `examples/sse_counter.zig` - Updated HTML to show curl commands
- `examples/sse_minimal.zig` - Created minimal working SSE example
- `build.zig` - Added sse_minimal to build configuration

## Next Steps
1. Replace blocking sleep() with libxev timers in the counter example
2. Create a timer-based counter implementation
3. Test with multiple concurrent SSE connections
4. Update all SSE examples to use non-blocking patterns
5. Document the SSE API and best practices

## Working SSE Pattern
```zig
// Handler
fn sseHandler(event: *h3z.Event) !void {
    try event.startSSE();
    event.setStreamCallback(streamCallback);
}

// Callback (no blocking operations!)
fn streamCallback(writer: *h3z.SSEWriter) !void {
    defer writer.close();
    
    // Send events without blocking
    try writer.sendEvent(h3z.SSEEvent{
        .data = "Hello!",
        .event = "message",
        .id = "1",
    });
}
```

## Testing
```bash
# Terminal 1
zig build run-sse_minimal

# Terminal 2
curl -N http://localhost:3000/events
# Output: event: test\nid: 1\ndata: Hello from SSE!\n\n
```

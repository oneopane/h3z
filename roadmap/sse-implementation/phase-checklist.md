# SSE Implementation Phase Checklist

## Phase 1: Core SSE Types and Formatting ‚è≥

### Implementation Tasks
- [ ] Create `src/http/sse.zig`
  - [ ] Define `SSEEvent` struct
  - [ ] Implement `format()` method for event serialization
  - [ ] Handle multi-line data properly
  - [ ] Add builder pattern for convenient event creation

### Code Structure
- [ ] SSEEvent with fields: data, event, id, retry
- [ ] Formatting follows W3C SSE specification
- [ ] Proper handling of newlines in data field
- [ ] Memory-efficient string building

### Verification
- [ ] Unit tests for SSEEvent formatting
- [ ] Test multi-line data handling
- [ ] Test optional fields (event, id, retry)
- [ ] Verify output matches SSE spec exactly

## Phase 2: Connection Abstraction Layer ‚è≥

### Implementation Tasks
- [ ] Create `src/server/connection.zig`
  - [ ] Define `Connection` interface
  - [ ] Add `writeChunk` method signature

### Design Decisions
- [ ] Use tagged union for implementation storage
- [ ] Define error set for connection operations
- [ ] Consider backpressure handling interface
- [ ] Plan for connection lifecycle management

### Verification
- [ ] Interface compiles without errors
- [ ] Can be imported by both adapters
- [ ] Methods have appropriate error handling
- [ ] Documentation is complete

## Phase 3: Adapter Modifications ‚è≥

### LibXev Adapter Tasks
- [ ] Modify `src/server/adapters/libxev.zig`
  - [ ] Implement Connection interface
  - [ ] Add write queue for chunked writes
  - [ ] Handle write completions properly

  - [ ] Implement backpressure management

### Std Adapter Tasks
- [ ] Modify `src/server/adapters/std.zig`
  - [ ] Implement Connection interface
  - [ ] Add streaming write support
  - [ ] Handle partial writes
  - [ ] Keep connection alive for SSE
  - [ ] Simple backpressure handling

### Common Requirements
- [ ] Both adapters expose Connection interface
- [ ] Proper error propagation
- [ ] Memory management for queued writes
- [ ] Connection cleanup on close

### Verification

## Phase 4: H3Event SSE Integration ‚è≥

### Implementation Tasks
- [ ] Modify `src/core/event.zig`
  - [ ] Add `startSSE()` method
  - [ ] Return `SSEWriter` instance
  - [ ] Prevent double response sending
  - [ ] Integrate with existing response system

### SSEWriter Implementation
- [ ] Create SSEWriter struct in `src/http/sse.zig`
  - [ ] Hold connection reference
  - [ ] Track headers sent state
  - [ ] Implement `sendEvent()` method
  - [ ] Implement `close()` method
  - [ ] Send proper SSE headers on first write

### Headers to Send
- [ ] Content-Type: text/event-stream
- [ ] Cache-Control: no-cache
- [ ] Connection: keep-alive
- [ ] X-Accel-Buffering: no (for nginx)

### Verification
- [ ] startSSE prevents regular response
- [ ] SSE headers are sent correctly
- [ ] Events are properly formatted
- [ ] Connection stays open
- [ ] Memory is managed correctly

  - [ ] Test SSEEvent formatting
  - [ ] Test SSEWriter functionality
  - [ ] Test error conditions
  - [ ] Test memory management

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Create `tests/integration/sse_test.zig`
  - [ ] Test full SSE flow with server
  - [ ] Test long-running connections
  - [ ] Test concurrent SSE connections
  - [ ] Test error recovery
  - [ ] Test both adapters

### Examples
- [ ] Create `examples/sse_basic.zig`
  - [ ] Simple counter that streams numbers

# H3Z Development Roadmap

This directory contains roadmaps and planning documents for the H3Z HTTP framework development.

## Current Roadmaps

### 1. [Cleanup Redundancies](./cleanup-redundancies.md)
**Status**: Planning  
**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks  
**Priority**: High

A comprehensive workflow to remove code redundancies and simplify the H3Z architecture. This includes:
- Router system consolidation (~40% reduction)
- Middleware system unification
- Directory structure cleanup
- Server adapter deduplication
- Configuration and utilities cleanup

### 2. [Redundancy Analysis](./redundancy-analysis.md)
**Status**: Complete  
**Type**: Analysis Document

Detailed analysis of all redundancies found in the codebase, including:
- Duplicate implementations
- Unused code
- Over-engineered components
- Configuration sprawl

## Future Roadmaps (Planned)
